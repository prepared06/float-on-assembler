# float-on-assembler
This is my individual work from discipline OC. The task was to solve the mathematical expression
(1+cos(5.23-4.5))/(2*23.56-71.3). To calculate mathematical operations, a coprocessor is used. 
Although using the coprocessor is not troublesome, a special procedure is used to output the 
float number, which takes up most of the space in the code.
